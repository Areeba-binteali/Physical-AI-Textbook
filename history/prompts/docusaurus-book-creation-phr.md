## Problem, Hypothesis, Resolution (PHR)

**Problem:** The user requested a Docusaurus setup to exclusively render existing book content from the root `/docs` directory. The setup required a "docs-only" configuration, elimination of all default Docusaurus content, and a custom sidebar structure accurately reflecting the book's modules and chapters. The initial Docusaurus project contained boilerplate files, misconfigured paths, YAML parsing errors in markdown, and broken internal links, preventing a successful build.

**Hypothesis:** By systematically refining the Docusaurus configuration files, removing extraneous default content, correcting document ID references within the sidebar, rectifying front matter syntax, and updating navigation links, the project will successfully build, presenting only the designated book content without errors or unwanted elements.

**Resolution:**

1.  **`docusaurus.config.js` Updates:**
    *   Revised `title`, `tagline`, `organizationName`, `projectName`, and `copyright` for project relevance.
    *   Removed the `blog` plugin and its associated configurations.
    *   Set `docs.path` to `../docs` for correct referencing of the root `docs` directory.
    *   Eliminated `docs.editUrl`.
    *   Adjusted `navbar.title` and `navbar.logo.href` to point to the book's introductory chapter (`/docs/module-1-ros2/introduction`).
    *   Streamlined `navbar.items` and `footer.links` to exclusively feature book navigation.

2.  **Default Content Removal:**
    *   Forcefully deleted all default Docusaurus files and directories, including `website/docs/intro.md`, `website/docs/tutorial-basics`, `website/docs/tutorial-extras`, `website/blog`, and `website/src/pages` example files (`index.js`, `index.module.css`, `markdown-page.md`).

3.  **`sidebars.js` Configuration:**
    *   Replaced the default `autogenerated` sidebar with a manually structured `bookSidebar`.
    *   Accurately mapped all book modules as categories and their chapters as items, correcting document IDs to match Docusaurus's slug generation (e.g., stripping numeric prefixes where applicable).
    *   Updated `navbar.sidebarId` in `docusaurus.config.js` to reference `bookSidebar`.

4.  **Markdown Content Rectification:**
    *   Fixed a YAML parsing error in `docs/module-4-vla/03-language-to-plan.md` by enclosing the `title` in double quotes.
    *   Removed a duplicated and malformed XML snippet from `docs/module-2-digital-twin/03-physics-simulation.md` that caused MDX compilation failures.

5.  **Final Verification:**
    *   Executed `npm run build` in the `website` directory, which completed successfully without any errors or warnings, confirming full compliance with all user requirements.
